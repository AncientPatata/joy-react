# Joy

An attempt to integrate Narra into some "visual novel" like software for stories. If nothing else it helped shape Narra and adapt it to more different usecases. 

## Usage
Clone this repository and my narra-rs repo
Install the packages
```
npm install
```
Make the narra_rs dependency `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` point to your local narra-rs folder (AncientPatata/narra-rs) 
then run the following command to build and run the project
```
npm run tauri dev
```
